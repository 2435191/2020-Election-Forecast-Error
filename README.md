# 2020-Election-Forecast-Error

CSVs: 
* `forecast_pres` contains [data from the 538 GitHub](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2020-general-data/presidential_state_toplines_2020.csv).
* `polls_bias_pres` contains data that I enter in manually from www.politico.com as well as data from `forecast_pres`.

The rest is hopefully self-documenting.
